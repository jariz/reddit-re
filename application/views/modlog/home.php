        <p><h2>What is it?</h2>
            The open modlog is an easily set up tool provided here at <a href="http://reddit.re">reddit.re</a>, It allows moderators to open up their activities to the community.</p>
        <p><h2>Why should I use it?</h2>
            It allows for transparency towards your community, People will know who banned who, Who removed what post, etc.<br>It can be quite useful.</p>
        <p><h2>How does it work?</h2>You simply provide the subreddit it needs to log and the subreddit it'll post all of the recent modlog entries into.
        <h4><span class="badge badge-warning">Warning</span> Make sure that the bot (<a href="http://reddit.com/u/PublicModlog">PublicModlog</a>) is moderator in the subreddit it's going to log and in the subreddit it's going to post.</h4></p>

    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p><strong>How can I remove a bot after creation?</strong><br><i>You can log in with your reddit.re account to remove the bot</i></p>
    <p><strong>How can I modify a bot after creation?</strong><br><i>You can only change some small settings. Once created you can't change any settings such as subreddits, username etc. <br>You can remove the bot and then recreate it.</i></p>
    <p><strong>I created one, but it doesn't show up in the destination subreddit yet!</strong><br><i>Public Modlog runs every 5 minutes, It has probably already posted something while you were looking for this message ;)</i></p>
