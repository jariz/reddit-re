    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p><strong>How can I remove a bot after creation?</strong><br><i>You can log in with your bot's reddit username and password to remove the bot</i></p>
    <p><strong>How can I modify a bot after creation?</strong><br><i>You can only change some small settings. Once created you can't change any settings such as subreddits, username etc. <br>You can remove the bot and then recreate it.</i></p>
    <p><strong>I created one, but it doesn't show up in the destination subreddit yet!</strong><br><i>Public Modlog runs every 5 minutes, It has probably already posted something while you were looking for this message ;)</i></p>
